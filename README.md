# DS4A 2020 - Team 19 Final Project

#### Before Starting Work
Make sure you update your local files with the files in the repo in case someone else updated their changes:

`git pull`

#### After Making Changes
Update local files again:

`git pull`

#### Push Changes to Repo
Stage your files to commit:

`git add file1.ipynb file2.csv` or if you want to update all files `git add .`

Commit changes:

`git commit -m "Here is a descriptive message about what is being committed"`

IF IT IS YOUR FIRST TIME MAKING CHANGES TO THE REPO, USE THIS:

`git push -u origin master`

If you have already made changes previously, push changes to repo:

`git push`
